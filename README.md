# auraxis.network

Interlink communication network set in the fictional world of Auraxis. Auraxis is the planet where the [Planetside](https://www.planetside2.com/) story takes place. This is a website, a collection of resources, and a set of services that make up a fictional representation of what might exist in the Planetside game, as if they were regular websites and web applications on the internet.

Basically, it's a fun experiment.
